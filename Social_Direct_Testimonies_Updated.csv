Myanmar,MYO,,Salvation,Families,Both,Prior to Oct 2023,"Last February, I had the opportunity to entrust an explorer from northern Shan State, Myanmar, to a digital pioneer.

Son together with Nastia comes to the church for children’s ministry, daughter comes to the Youth gathering.

Nepal,NEP,,Explorer evangelism,Distance discipleship,NPI,Prior to Oct 2023,"Hi Cv Family. Here's a Testimonies of our seeker and his journey.
In the year 2022, something remarkable began to unfold in the Himalayas. It's a story about how God's power is at work, transforming lives and bringing light to a place where it was in darkness. 
Meet Mahendra, a man deeply rooted in the Hindu faith, to the extreme. He was filled with questions, and sometimes it was risky for us to invite him directly to our church. So, we decided to invite him to our online fellowships, and something amazing started to happen. He continued joining our fellowships for a whole month, and during this time, we also connected him with our church community.

Myanmar,MYO,,Multiple outcomes,Local community,NPI,Prior to Oct 2023,"This story is shared by our former pioneer Tin Htay who is also a church partner in our P100N project for Bama people group. Tin Htay continuously proves himself to be an effective pioneer in reaching his fellow Bama Buddhists to Christ. His newly planted church grows from zero to nearly a hundred of weekly attendees.
Just recently, he finds a very effective way of reaching new people from his Buddhist community. What he does is this. He asks people to write the Gospel of John on exercise book and give them about $15 AUD as an appreciation gift for completion of the handwriting of John Gospel. As the people write it down, he asks them to underline words or sentences they don't understand. This way, he supports the needy and also reaches them with the gospel.
As a result, there are almost a hundred of people who have finished hand-writing of John gospel. A few dozens of them show up at Sunday service weekly. The pioneer invited the high-value lead explorers to gospel events which he conducts once every month. Through this activity, six people have already confessed their trust in Jesus as Savior and received water baptism last month.

FB OBJ1 Great story 
Hisham's journey began with an unexpected contact. He stumbled upon one of our OBJ1 pages, not knowing its content. Yet, what initially seemed like a chance encounter soon revealed a deeper yearning within him. Hisham expressed his love for Christ and a desire to learn more about His teachings and the Christian faith.
 
As we engaged in conversation, we shared the fundamental beliefs of Christianity, emphasizing our faith in one God. We delved into the profound question of the divinity of Jesus Christ, providing evidence and insights to support this crucial aspect of Christian doctrine.
 
In a moment of grace, something remarkable occurred - Hisham embraced the belief that Jesus Christ is God. He made a profound declaration of his newfound faith. This transformative experience marked the beginning of a shared journey, one of discipleship and deepening knowledge.
 
Together, we embarked on the exploration of the Bible, allowing its words to illuminate our path. In unity, we prayed for the steadfastness and earnestness of Hisham's spiritual journey, and for the continued growth of his faith. This story exemplifies the profound and enduring power of faith, understanding, and the love of Christ.

After hearing his story, we shared the message of Jesus'' love with him. We explained that even though life can be tough and not go as planned, God can provide the right things at the right time. We assured him that in Jesus, there is eternal peace and life. We prayed for him and talked with him on the phone. Surprisingly, he expressed a desire to connect with a church.

Sri Lanka,SIN,,Healing,Local community,NPI,Dec 2023,"In the Badulla area, Pioneer Susil's encounter with Sanduni, a 28-year-old resident of Uduwara, unfolds as a testament to God's miraculous intervention. Sanduni, initially indifferent to Jesus, grappled with the challenges of her husband's alcoholism. The pivotal moment arrived when the couple, by chance, found themselves near the church.
 
Although the initial interaction was unresponsive, Pioneer Susil, driven by an inexplicable urge, persisted. In a strange twist of fate, Sanduni suffered a car accident within three days. Susil rushed to the hospital, where doctors recommended major surgery, insisting on inserting metal wires to fix her broken and seriously injured ribs. However, Susil's fervent prayers invoked a miraculous healing. Against medical expectations, Sanduni underwent only minor surgery and is able to walk now though doctors have advised her to rest at home for a few months. 
 
This remarkable testimony stands as a powerful proclamation of Jesus' healing grace, and Susil expresses heartfelt gratitude for God's transformative work in their community.

Ewin and Agus had been communicating for weeks, initially through chats and video calls on WhatsApp. Their digital connection paved the way for a much-anticipated face-to-face meeting.
 
During their encounter, Agus shared more about Jesus and prayed for Ewin and his family. Although Ewin has not yet embraced faith in Jesus, the seeds of the Gospel were sown. This meeting was not just a spiritual outreach; it also encompassed caring for physical well-being. Agus brought medical equipment to conduct health checkups for Ewin''s wife and brother. Initially intending to meet only Ewin, Agus found an opportunity to connect with his entire family. This was especially timely as Ewin''s uncle was ill, allowing Agus to combine medical assistance with sharing the message of Jesus.
 
This story is just the beginning of a hopeful journey. We ask for prayers for Agus, that he may continue to build a strong relationship with Ewin''s family. Through these bonds, there is hope that one day they will open their hearts to Jesus and embrace the Gospel. Amen');"

A tale of resilience, faith, and newfound hope unfolded in the remote corners of Laos, where financial barriers crumbled in the face of spiritual discovery.

Sarica Chamling, from Ilam, joined us and opened up about her experiences. Initially, our conversation was casual, but as we began to discuss God's love, Sarica shared her background. She used to attend church with her family as she had married into a Christian household. However, her life took a turn when her husband remarried six years ago, leaving her and their young son. This led to a divorce, and she moved back to her parents' home with her son.
During our talk, Sarica was troubled by numerous questions, particularly about how her Christian husband could betray her. She felt that her connection with a Christian family didn't allow her to deepen her faith in Christ. As she voiced her concerns and shared her anguish, we tried to help her understand that merely changing one's religion doesn't necessarily change one's heart. For a true transformation, one must encounter Jesus in spirit and truth. We explained that someone who genuinely understands Jesus Christ's essence would not inflict pain on others. We conveyed to her that, although her ex-husband and his family may have failed her, Jesus's love for her remains unwavering. We reassured her with God's promises, emphasizing that He has grand plans for her and will never abandon her.
By the end of our extensive discussion, Sarica felt a renewed trust in Jesus and His love, expressing a willingness to return to church and embrace Jesus as her savior. We are grateful to God for touching her heart and reminding her of His unwavering love. We continue to pray for her bright future. Testimonies

In Keenadeniya, Mirigama, a village nestled near a towering mountain, many impoverished residents have long been overlooked. Pioneer Venura Manoj, undeterred by the challenges, tirelessly shares the message of hope with these neglected souls.
Nishi Withana, a mother of two, epitomized the struggles of the community. Neglected even by her own relatives, Nishi found us through Facebook and became an offliner. After she found work abroad, she invited Pioneer Venura to meet her children being looked after by her mother in the village. Embracing Jesus Christ as her savior, Nishi's newfound faith sparked a ripple effect of change. Doors of opportunity swung open, providing previously absent income streams for families like hers. The once-shrouded village now radiates with newfound hope, with Nishi's home serving as a home-cell for spiritual revival.
Similarly, another household faced relentless challenges, with the wife contemplating suicide amidst overwhelming struggles. However, through the power of prayer and Pioneer Venura's guidance, the family experienced a miraculous turnaround. Securing stable employment and finding new sources of income, they emerged from darkness into the light of hope and renewal.
In another household, the challenges were equally daunting, with a husband incapacitated by a debilitating condition and a grandfather battling cancer. Undeterred, the wife courageously shouldered the burden of caring for her family. Through Venura's fervent prayers, the family witnessed miraculous healing, both physically and spiritually. With the husband securing stable employment and the wife finding a source of income, their lives were irrevocably transformed by the power of faith
 
These testimonies underscore the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative impact of unwavering faith. Despite the rugged terrain and daunting obstacles, the home cell meetings continue to thrive, a testament to the enduring power of community and the boundless grace of God.

Now, a small fellowship has emerged, comprising devout baptised believers who have embraced Christ under a simple plastic shelter. This fellowship has become a beacon of hope for the village, where people gather to pray for their community and its recovery.

Nepal,NEP,,,,,March 2024,"In the heights of the Upper Himalayas, where the Jesus's name still sound foreign amidst a backdrop of deep-rooted Hindu culture, our journey began. Though we found salvation, our hearts were burdened for our people, for the families dwelling in those distant lands, overlooked and rejected time and again. Yet, our faith in Christ remained unwavering.
Turning to the social needs of the community, we embarked on a mission to share the gospel, using the tools of evangelism to pave the way. In this rugged Himalayan terrain, where landslides plague every season and footpaths crumble, we envisioned a path to not just connectivity but salvation.
With a shovel in hand, the pioneering spirit led us to construct roads, initially to schools, but ultimately leading to the Gospel. What began as a solitary endeavor soon blossomed into a communal effort, as villagers joined in, transforming mere pathways into avenues of acceptance and faith.
As the roads took shape, so did the new fellowship of believers. In the village deprived of electricity, we gathered under the glow of solar panels and mobile flash lights sharing the timeless stories of the Gospel and watching testimonies (CVR) And amidst these gatherings, our prayers intertwined with the words of Jesus, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life.""
This village found the way truth and the life !

Sri Lanka,SIN,,,,Both,May 2024,"Dear Friends at Testimonies Channel, here is an amazing testimony of the Lord's saving grace!
 
During the challenging times of COVID-19 in 2021, the CV team handed over an offliner to Pioneer Rasmo, serving in Katana, Western Province, Sri Lanka. Pioneer Rasmo, with excitement, agreed to communicate and visit the offliner.
 
Upon meeting the off-liner and his friends including Idunil, all struggling with heroin addiction, Despite Pioneer Rasmo's earnest attempts to share the message of salvation, they approached his efforts with skepticism, challenging him to demonstrate the ""power of Jesus to change their lives."" Nevertheless, Pioneer Rasmo remained steadfast in his commitment to reaching out to the off- liner, his friends and Indunil. He maintained contact and fervently prayed for their salvation.
Idunil is a father of two, struggling with heroin addiction for more than 18 years. Additionally, he had been served a five-year sentence in prison for drugs and theft-related offenses and was suffering from a severe skin disease covering two-thirds of his body.
A year later, Pioneer Rasmo received the joyful news that both the off-liner and Idunil had enrolled in a Christian rehabilitation center near their homes. There, they received deliverance from addiction through the saving grace of Jesus. Idunil testified that during his time at the Christian rehabilitation center, he recalled the message shared by Pioneer Rasmo. This inspired him to fast and pray for deliverance from drugs and healing for his skin disease. Miraculously, his prayers were swiftly answered—he was healed and no longer harbored cravings for drugs.
This transformation inspired Idunil to embark on a journey of full-time ministry. Though once rejected by his entire village due to his addiction, he and his family are now warmly embraced, with nearly 25 families gathering at their home for worship. Idunil's son was once rejected and bullied at school because of his father's addiction but is now accepted in his school. In a remarkable turn of events, the school even invited Idunil to speak to the children about awareness towards drugs.
We, the CV team, praise the Lord for answering Pioneer Rasmo's prayers and commend his unwavering dedication to sharing the Gospel. In March 2024, CV recruited Idunil as a Pioneer, and we are committed to providing both financial and spiritual support for the next three years.

Sri Lanka,SIN,,,,,May 2024,"Dear Friends,  here is a testament to the transformative power of faith in the saving grace of Jesus, Chamila's journey from despair to hope.
As a mother of two living in Diulapitiya, Gampaha district in Sri Lanka, her life was marred by the destructive grip of addiction and abuse. Her husband's alcoholism and her son's drug addiction (drug named crystal meth, nicknamed ice locally) cast a dark shadow over their household, leaving Chamila to endure physical and verbal abuse in silence.
Amidst the chaos, Chamila, in her desperate state, stumbled upon CV's Facebook Ad campaign and bravely shared her contact details, hopeful that someone would reach out and offer a glimmer of hope amidst her despair. The CV team assigned Pioneer Rosary to maintain contact with Chamila, ensuring that she receives the message of hope and salvation. Regular visits and prayers offered solace and companionship, providing a beacon of light in the darkest moments of Chamila’s life. Through the unwavering support of Pioneer Rosary, Chamila found the courage to embrace faith and accept Jesus as her Savior.
The ripple effects of Chamila's newfound faith were profound. Within a year, her entire family experienced a spiritual awakening, renouncing their destructive habits and embracing a life of purpose and grace. The husband's newfound job opportunity, coupled with free housing, alleviated their financial burdens and provided a fresh start.
In March 2024, Chamila and her family, along with their in-laws, were baptized, marking a significant milestone in their journey of faith. Inspired by her transformative experience, Chamila's home has blossomed into a vibrant house church, attracting believers from the neighborhood and beyond.
Today, Chamila stands as a beacon of hope and inspiration, sharing the message of salvation with her community. Under the guidance of Pioneer Rosary, she is being trained to become a Pioneer successor, carrying forward the transformation initiated by CV's NPI and social direct campaigns.
We celebrate Chamila's story as a testament to the transformative power of faith in the community. Through CV's initiatives, lives are being changed, and souls are finding redemption, bringing hope and healing to communities in need.

Below are the numbers, but more importantly, they reflect real-life transformations. Here’s a testimony from one of our online learners who connected with a church through efforts.
Testimony
Saurabh Gotame, a Nepali-speaking explorer, has been living in Malaysia for the past three years. He initially moved abroad to support his family in Nepal financially. However, life took a toll on him, and for almost a year, he struggled with depression, feeling unloved and lonely. Sleepless nights and negative thoughts became constant companions, affecting his overall health. Regular hospital visits drained his savings, pushing him further into poverty and despair. We added him in the online learning groups.
During this challenging time, Saurabh saw an online sermon titled ""Our Identity in Christ"". Slowly, we shared the love of Christ and the gospel with him. Over time, his curiosity about Jesus grew, and we discipled him online for several months. We connected Saurabh to a Nepali-speaking fellowship, Taman Perbwira Nepali Sangati In Malaysia . Now, he actively participates in the fellowship. Additionally, Saurabh has found employment and has started working in a company, marking a positive turn in his life. All glory to our almighty God.

Vietnam,VIE,,,,,July 2024,"Four people from different areas where it's hard to find a local church gather weekly on Zoom for a Bible study. This is a wonderful story from our new pioneer, Sac, in Northern Vietnam.
 
These seekers found out about Jesus through our videos on Facebook. Each one had their own issues when they started looking for Him. A young girl was feeling depressed. A boy was looking for hope in Jesus. A woman, recovering from a broken same-sex relationship, sought healing from God.
 
Sac shared that it was challenging to connect with them since they rarely replied or engaged. Their different schedules also made it tough to meet together. However, he kept praying for them and consistently sent testimony videos and encouraging words for a few weeks. Through the work of the Holy Spirit, they started joining the Bible study, which uses Alpha Online sessions, within two weeks already.

Bangladesh,BN-,,,,Both,September 2024,"Off-liner Ibrahim’s life seemed to be unraveling. After losing his business and being burdened by crushing debt, he reached a point of hopelessness.

When she knew that I had listened to her, encouraged her, and prayed for her, even sending her worship songs, she told me that she felt warm inside, and that she was experiencing a special love she had never felt before.

Myanmar,ENG,,Baptism,Development/success,Community,October 2024,"Dear Precious CV Family,
 
I want to share a story about a seeker who is now baptized and part of a local church.
 
On September 29th, a seeker came through Love Pathway in Gorgias. When he interacted with the bot, he said, “Let me have my sins washed away.” I found this unusual, so I paused the bot and started chatting with him. I asked for his contact information to arrange an in-person meeting.
 
At first, the phone number he gave seemed incomplete, so I had doubts about whether he was genuine. I messaged him again to confirm, and he sent the correct number. Since he lived nearby, I decided to meet him myself. When I called, a woman answered, which added to my doubts. I messaged him about it, and he clarified, “Oh, that’s my sister.”
We continued talking on the phone and arranged to meet in person. On October 3rd, 2024, we met at a restaurant. He shared his life story, the hardships he’d faced, the mistakes he’d made, and his strong desire to be cleansed by God. I shared with him about Jesus and His salvation, explaining that by believing in Him, he could be saved. Then, I prayed for him.
 
Before ending our meeting, I gave him a book called Who is Jesus? designed for people new to Christianity. Later, I asked if he’d started reading it, and he said he’d already read a third of it and found it very interesting. I encouraged him to keep praying and trusting in God.
 
The next day, I invited him to a church service, and he agreed to come. He joined us that Sunday, and we gave him a Bible. He came back the following week, and we gave him a study book from the Bible Society.
 
As our conversations continued, we discussed baptism, and he expressed a strong desire to be baptized. I explained that he would need to take a one-day class to understand its significance. On October 15th, 2024, he learned about Jesus’ salvation and the importance of water baptism. Finally, on October 29th, he was baptized in water, witnessed by others and in God’s presence. He has now begun his journey into a new life.

Nepal,TAM,,,,,Novemebr 2024,"Rajen** Bhomjan Tamang is a 23-year-old Buddhist man who has always valued peace. One day, he came across a post that said, ""You are here with a purpose."" This message really struck him. Growing up in a Buddhist family, he knew about peace, but he became curious about what peace means after life.
Rajendra had completed high school two years ago, but due to his family’s financial struggles, he had to stop his studies. He’s an intelligent young man, but despite his efforts, he couldn’t find a job, which left him feeling discouraged and hopeless.
We shared with him about the purpose of life and the right timing from the Bible, and had a positive conversation. He agreed with what we said, but was hesitant to go to church because of his Buddhist identity. Still, we prayed for him and reminded him that God loves him just as he is, no matter where he comes from or where he goes.

Bangladesh,BN-,,Multiple outcomes,Development/success,Both,February 2025,"My name is Billal Hossain, and I am 34 years old. I grew up in a Muslim family and worked in a garment factory. However, there were many aspects of Islam that troubled me, leaving me with questions and doubts.
One day, while scrolling through Facebook, I came across the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. I began to learn that Jesus offers forgiveness of sins and eternal life. As I continued to listen, something stirred within me. I decided to pray in Jesus' name, and to my surprise, I saw real changes in my life. Encouraged by these experiences, I started searching for a Christian congregation and eventually contacted by local  Church.
Through regular conversations, fellowship, and meetings with the church, I began to understand the truth of the gospel. The love and kindness I experienced among the believers deeply touched me. Finally, at an inspiring church gathering, I publicly accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. From that moment, I started attending church regularly, growing in faith and knowledge of God’s Word.
However, soon after accepting Jesus, I lost my job due to an economic downturn. Despite this hardship, I did not lose hope because I had placed my trust in God. Around this time, another miracle happened in my life. My wife, who had been told by doctors that she could never conceive, became pregnant. During her first cesarean delivery, her hemoglobin level dropped, and the doctors said she would need a blood transfusion. But I prayed, and by God’s grace, the surgery was successful without requiring extra blood. A similar miracle occurred during the birth of our second child. These events strengthened my faith even more.
As my wife witnessed God’s miraculous provision in our lives, she, too, became curious about Jesus. She started attending church with me, and over time, she came to believe in Christ as her Savior. Today, she follows Jesus alongside me.
After losing my job, I tried to start a clothing sales business, but I struggled due to a lack of capital. Even in this challenging time, God showed His faithfulness. The church and some organizations extended a helping hand, providing support in our time of need. Church members also helped us personally, showing the love of Christ in action.
Now, my heart burns with a desire to share the message of Jesus with my Muslim brothers. I want them to experience the same freedom and salvation that I have found in Christ. To fulfill this calling, I dedicate time to the church’s mission activities and remain actively involved in sharing the gospel.

One day, he came across our video on “Dealing with Stress” on Facebook. It touched his heart, and he reached out to us, sharing that he was exhausted from trying to hold his marriage together. At 60 years old, he longed for healing and reconciliation, but he didn’t know where to turn. He was searching for help… and for hope from God.

Bangladesh,BN-,,Multiple outcomes,Local community,Both,April 2025,"In a quiet village tucked within the North District of Bangladesh, a man named Bulbul Sarkar lived a life like many others surrounded by tradition, shaped by his culture, and guided by the teachings he had known since childhood. But deep within him stirred a yearning and an unspoken search for truth and peace.
Bulbul encountered the gospel through an unexpected path: the JEEBON JOL Facebook page. In a country where Christianity is often misunderstood and viewed with suspicion, especially in rural areas, it takes great courage to even explore the Bible. Yet Bulbul did. One of our pioneers shared a digital link to the Bible with him. Quietly, without telling anyone, he began to read.
As he read, something began to change. The words of Jesus touched his heart. The message of love, sacrifice, and redemption broke through fear and doubt. Alone in his room, Bulbul wept. He confessed with his mouth and believed in his heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. In December 2023, he took a bold step, he was baptized in water, declaring his faith publicly despite what it might cost him.
Bulbul began attending a local church in his village. He prayed earnestly, seeking to grow in the Lord. But his journey was far from easy. His wife, Tahmina, was deeply opposed to his decision. In a conservative Muslim household, such a change is seen not just as betrayal, but as shame. Bulbul faced not only emotional rejection but cultural tension that could have torn his family apart.
Yet, instead of arguing or forcing her to understand, he gently shared the Word of God with his wife. He continued to love her, to pray for her, and to answer her questions with patience and humility. Over time, God worked in Tahmina’s heart. She, too, began to read the Bible. And in December 2024, a year after Bulbul’s baptism, she gave her life to Christ and was baptized at the local church led by Pioneer Mafuja Apa.
Today, Bulbul is not only a faithful church member, but he is also being discipled by Pioneer Mafuja Apa to become a leader himself, a possible successor in the ministry. In a nation where choosing Christ can mean social rejection, economic hardship, or worse, Bulbul and Tahmina stand firm in their faith.
Please continue to pray for them. Pray that they will grow deeper in their relationship with Christ, that they will be protected from persecution, and that their testimony might lead others in their village to the truth of the gospel.
In Bangladesh, choosing Jesus is not just a spiritual decision it is a sacrifice. But as Bulbul and Tahmina have shown, it is a sacrifice worth making.

And in December 2024, a year after Bulbul’s baptism, she gave her life to Christ and was baptized at the local church led by Pioneer Mafuja Apa.
Today, Bulbul is not only a faithful church member, but he is also being discipled by Pioneer Mafuja Apa to become a leader himself, a possible successor in the ministry. In a nation where choosing Christ can mean social rejection, economic hardship, or worse, Bulbul and Tahmina stand firm in their faith.
Please continue to pray for them. Pray that they will grow deeper in their relationship with Christ, that they will be protected from persecution, and that their testimony might lead others in their village to the truth of the gospel.
In Bangladesh, choosing Jesus is not just a spiritual decision it is a sacrifice. But as Bulbul and Tahmina have shown, it is a sacrifice worth making. Please keep them in you prayer');"

Nepal,NEP,,Healing,Explorer growth ,Community,April 2025,"Hello, I am Gopal Rai, from Nepal.
I went through a broken relationship and felt completely hopeless. I’ve been married for 11 years after a 5-year love relationship. I loved and trusted my wife deeply. She was everything to me. But she changed. She alleged that I was being dishonest. Yes, I wasn’t a perfect husband. I made mistakes. But I longed to apologize, and I asked for forgiveness but no matter how many times I tried, she didn’t forgive me. 
I was overwhelmed with regret, pain, and loneliness. I cried often, struggled with sleepless nights, and even questioned whether life was worth living. The only thing that kept me going was thinking about my mother.
One day, I came across a Facebook post from Jeevan Ko Aasha that asked, “Have you ever felt a love that forgives all your mistakes?”
That post touched me deeply. I reached out, and they listened to my story. They shared the love of God; a love that forgives, heals, and never changes. Through their support, I remembered a friend who follows Jesus. I went to church with him, and there, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior.

India,guj,Patel ,Multiple outcomes,Local community,Both,April 2025,"I want to share with you today an encouraging story from our pioneer, Priyanka, from the state of Gujarat in India whose faithfulness is changing lives in such powerful ways.
 
Not long ago, Priyanka met a man named Sanjay Bariya through our Gunjan Gujarati page. She was only able to engage with him for a brief period of time—but God often works in what seems like a passing moment. Because before he disconnected from her, Sanjay introduced Priyanka to his sister, Chetna.
 
Chetna is a widow. A mother of three—two daughters and a son—trying to hold life together. She was burdened with the weight of her circumstances and her hope had grown dim.
 
Priyanka saw in Chetna a woman deeply loved by God and persisted in connecting with her and encouraging her. She began visiting Chetna’s home—not with an agenda to evangelize but with something far more powerful: prayer, presence, and the promises of Scripture.
 
She spoke to Chetna about Jesus. Not just as a religious figure, but as the Prince of Peace. The One who steps into sorrow and sits with the broken-hearted. The One who can hold shattered lives in His nail-scarred hands and breathe peace where there’s only been pain.
 
And something began to shift. Chetna began to believe. She chose to follow Jesus. And today, that very same home—once filled with grief—now hosts a house fellowship. Worship. Prayer. Hope. Right there in her living room.
 
All glory to God!

Sri Lanka,SIN,,Salvation,Families,NPI,May 2025,"In February, Pioneer Indunil received an unexpected call from a friend, urgently requesting his help for a woman believed to be possessed by a demon. Sensing an opportunity to minister, Indunil decided to visit her with his wife. When they arrived, they met the family: Dilini and her husband were both deaf and mute, with two children. The elder son, just 13 years old, was able to speak and had learned sign language to communicate with his parents.
 
Through the boy, Pioneer Indunil learned of the mother’s torment. She had been suffering for three months, claiming that a spirit inside her was eating her flesh. The family, in desperation, had taken her to multiple places: temples, local witch doctors, and even her mother-in-law, who was a witch doctor herself. Nothing brought relief. Eventually, they admitted her to the General Hospital in Matara, but her condition only worsened. She could no longer walk and was left crawling inside her own home. The family had reached the end of their rope—their neighbor calling Pioneer Indunil was their last resort.
 
Indunil and his wife prayed earnestly for Dilini and her family, though the experience was spiritually intense and challenging. He was unsure to what extent she understood the message of salvation, as it was being communicated in sign language by her young son. Still, led by faith, Pioneer Indunil chose to take a different approach. He prayed a prayer of repentance on her behalf, breaking any spiritual bondages or effects of witchcraft that might have taken hold—particularly as the in-laws, who practiced witchcraft, lived in the same household.
 
After the prayer, an overwhelming peace filled the atmosphere. Sensing the breakthrough, Indunil invited the entire family to church. On the 26th of February, they came—every one of them—and joined the fellowship. Since that day, Dilini has experienced immense peace, free from demonic torment. Miraculously, she regained her strength and now walks over 4 kilometers daily to take her younger child to school.
 
Also, her husband, who had given up work to look after his wife, found a job through divine intervention. Now the mother in law who was a witch doctor and having a kali temple in the same premises also wants our pioneer to pray for her.   Pioneer Indunil believes the transformation in this family is nothing short of the divine hand of God resting upon them.

When I met him two months ago, I was struck by his honesty and spiritual hunger. With quiet conviction, he told me, “There is only one true faith on this earth and that is Christianity.” Those words weren’t just spoken they were felt, deeply. Rafiq poured himself into the Bible, reading it from cover to cover in a short time. “When I read the Bible,” he told me with tears in his eyes, “I felt peace real peace for the first time in my life.”
One day, with a heart full of repentance, he sat with me, confessed his sins openly, and we prayed together. In that sacred moment, Rafiq accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior and Redeemer. It was a beautiful, holy encounter one I will never forget.
He now longs to take the next step in his faith and receive baptism. To help him grow in his walk with Christ, I gave him the Holy New Testament, the Gospel of John, and an audio Bible to accompany him in his quiet hours.

As the truth shared, Kiky was deeply moved, even brought to tears. He confessed that he had never heard these things before. That day, he made a personal confession of repentance and received Jesus into his life.

I felt a calling in my heart that I couldn’t ignore. Alongside my wife, we made the life-changing decision to follow Christ and were baptized together. It was a moment of great joy, but it also meant leaving behind the faith of our ancestors.
The road hasn’t been easy. Our decision to embrace Christianity has brought us opposition from our families and community.

Indonesia,IND,,,Explorer growth ,Both,June 2025,"*Don grew up in a devout Muslim household. Back in 2015, he moved to Manado for work, where he lived with his Christian mother-in-law. She often talked about the Bible and invited him to learn more about Jesus. But at the time, Don kept his distance. After she passed away in 2021, life grew increasingly difficult—his marriage ended, finances collapsed, and each job opportunity slipped through his fingers. He felt stuck and spiritually lost.
 
Then came the dreams. In one, his mother-in-law appeared again—this time with a gentle voice, inviting him to follow a path of peace. He saw a massive ship out at sea, reminding him of the very journey he once took to Manado. The dream felt too real to ignore, and yet too terrifying to process. So he buried it.
 
Until recently.
 
A few weeks ago, Don stumbled upon one of our Indonesian pages and began interacting with the chatbot. The discussion about Jesus triggered the very memories he had worked hard to forget. But instead of fear, something different stirred—curiosity. He began asking questions: Who is this Jesus? Why is He so important? Is He really God?

Back in 2015, he moved to Manado for work, where he lived with his Christian mother-in-law. She often talked about the Bible and invited him to learn more about Jesus. But at the time, Don kept his distance. After she passed away in 2021, life grew increasingly difficult—his marriage ended, finances collapsed, and each job opportunity slipped through his fingers. He felt stuck and spiritually lost.
 
Then came the dreams. In one, his mother-in-law appeared again—this time with a gentle voice, inviting him to follow a path of peace. He saw a massive ship out at sea, reminding him of the very journey he once took to Manado. The dream felt too real to ignore, and yet too terrifying to process. So he buried it.
 
Until recently.
 
A few weeks ago, Don stumbled upon one of our Indonesian pages and began interacting with the chatbot. The discussion about Jesus triggered the very memories he had worked hard to forget. But instead of fear, something different stirred—curiosity. He began asking questions: Who is this Jesus? Why is He so important? Is He really God?

Nepal,NEP,,Church connection,Explorer growth ,Community,July 2025,"My name is Sagar GC. I’m from Nepal, and currently working as a chef in Karnal, India. My journey hasn’t been easy to explain, but I want to share it from the depths of my heart because I believe someone out there needs to hear it.
Life has been incredibly painful and confusing. I’ve battled addiction, loneliness, and spiritual darkness for a long time. I lost almost everything: my family, my friends, and even my identity. My wife left me, and I felt completely abandoned. There was a time when I didn’t even recognize myself. I tried to stay strong, smiling on the outside, but inside I was falling apart.
About 13 years ago, I had been attending  church in Kathmandu for several months. But something happened and I drifted away from the church and my faith. Since then, I was drawn deeper into negativity. I got so lost that I even tattooed 666, the mark of the devil, on my body believing lies and chasing darkness. Eventually, I realized that evil can only lead to emptiness and destruction.
In the middle of all this, I began to ask myself: What is the meaning of hope? What is the purpose of life? I had no answers. I felt like I had dishonored God and maybe, this was my punishment.
But unexpectedly , something changed. I reached out through a platform and began a small conversation first with a chatbot. That small digital response gave me the sense that someone was on the other side. Then a real person messaged me warmly, asking how my life had been. It may seem like a simple greeting, but in that moment, it felt like a door was opening a divine touch in a very lonely world.
That conversation on chat and later on a phone call reminded me of something powerful: God sees me, He still wants me, and is still calling me back. I realized: I am not invisible. I matter. And God is not done with me yet. I may be a broken , but Jesus wants to make me whole again.
That moment lead my faith journey. Now, I am determined to return to Jesus. I want to become a true child of God again. I’ve committed to attending church regularly. I know the enemy tried to write my story, but Jesus is rewriting it.
I’m also a writer and a musician. I believe God gave me these gifts for a purpose. I’m planning to shift to Kathmandu to find work and begin again with faith, creativity, and healing.

Both her children were suffering from intense emotional distress, and as a result would have fights, especially in the evenings when the family would gather at home. The atmosphere was filled with heaviness and pain. Shirani herself was deeply affected by the strife in the family and confessed that she often felt hopeless.
 
As a teacher, the burden of her responsibilities made it even harder for her to cope. Moved by compassion, Pioneer Velamma shared the Word of God and prayed earnestly for Shirani and her family.
 
Shortly after, Shirani, who once said, “Death would be better than this,” along with her entire family, accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Within days, the heavy burdens began to lift and peace entered their home.
 
Since then, Shirani has been actively sharing the Good News with others. Through her testimony, several families in her village have come to know Jesus Christ. Shirani and her two children were later baptized in water and are now receiving discipleship training in God’s ministry.

Sri Lanka,SIN,,Multiple outcomes,Distance discipleship,Both,August 2025,"For many Sri Lankan women from low income households, who are struggling to make ends meet and give their children a better future, the solution seems to be to secure employment as a housemaid in the Middle East. But once they get there, many face numerous challenges and hardships. Many of them have to work long hours without rest or adequate compensation, and suffer exploitation, mistreatment and even physical and verbal abuse at the hands of their employers. 
Raseema, a Sri Lankan woman was working as a domestic helper in Cyprus. Her responsibilities included caring for two children, preparing meals and managing all household tasks, leaving her emotionally overwhelmed and physically exhausted. At times, she felt completely hopeless and even lost the will to live.
 
As this was her first time in a foreign country, she had no one to turn to. It was in this state that she came across our Facebook page. Moved by what she saw, she reached out, leading to a connection with our former Pioneer Nirmali, who was serving in the Padukka area of Sri Lanka.
 
Raseema, who was born into a non Christian background, was introduced to the Word of God through  Nirmali. Over time, her faith grew stronger, and she came to accept Jesus Christ as the Lord and Savior of her life.
 
She stayed connected with  Nirmali through daily phone calls, learning the Word of God and participating in Sunday worship and personal prayer times through WhatsApp. During a particularly difficult period, when she had to leave her workplace and faced serious uncertainty, she committed those issues to God through prayer. Not long after, she was blessed with a new job in a different household. One that offered her joy, better pay and many blessings.
 
In just a short period of time, Raseema experienced a significant turnaround from great hardship to favor and provision from Jesus. As she continued to grow in faith and the Word of God, she joined a church in Cyprus. She is now receiving training to serve in God’s ministry work.

Nepal,NEP,,Church connection,Explorer growth ,Community,August 2025,"My name is Milan Tamang, from Nepal. My heart was completely broken.
After many years together, the person I loved left me without any reason . The pain was so heavy, and all I wanted was to forget everything. I felt completely alone and lost in the darkness.
In that desperate place, I found a Facebook  page sharing messages about Hope that came from Jesus. I had heard His name before, but no one had ever explained who He truly was. Feeling a tiny spark of curiosity, I sent a message. The person who replied listened to me. They cared. For the first time in a long time, I felt valued.
Slowly, through these conversations, I began to discover a love unlike any other—a love that promises to never leave, even when everyone else walks away. This was the start of my new faith journey. It wasn't about knowing all the answers; it was about finding a peace and comfort that nothing in this world could give me.
I found the courage to say, “Yes, I believe in Jesus. I love Him.” He has played the biggest part in healing my heart and making me happy again.
My faith journey has just begun. I know there is still so much to learn, but I am certain of this: when I was at my lowest, Jesus held me close. He gave me a hope I never thought possible.

""Our Direct CV team informed me that Ibu Sumiyati Mira had connected with us through our Direct page. She entered through one of the pathways and began chatting with a member of our community team. In those conversations, she shared her burdens and questions, and eventually agreed to be contacted by a pioneer to learn more about Jesus. Since she lived near me, I was the one who reached out.
 
When I visited her, her words pierced my heart. “Every day seems to get harder,” she said quietly. “What mistake in my life has brought me here?” She shared about her struggles—financial difficulties, family challenges, and even a recent fall that left her barely able to walk for days. Behind her voice was a soul longing for answers, a heart crying for peace.
 
As we continued talking, she told me about her family’s journey. Though her husband’s background was Christian, years ago—while serving in the military in Wonosobo—he met a Muslim teacher and eventually led their whole household into Islam. Over time, however, Ibu Sumiyati admitted that she never found peace there. Neither in Islam, nor in traditional Javanese beliefs, did she discover the rest her heart longed for. That day, she asked me to pray for her—her body was weak, but even more, her heart felt empty.
 
I prayed for her in the name of Isa Al-Masih. By God’s grace, she opened her heart and believed that Isa is the Savior. Though she has not yet been baptized—partly because of her fragile health and partly because of the pressures of her Muslim family—she confessed that for the first time she felt a deep peace when she heard about Jesus. In the days ahead, we will continue to walk carefully with her, building relationship, and trusting that God Himself will strengthen her faith. Walking away from that conversation, I realized again how God is already at work, far before we arrive. He prepares hearts, plants questions, and stirs restlessness so that the Gospel can be heard as living water to the thirsty.""

Sri Lanka,TAM,,Church connection,Families,Both,September 2025," Anand was a seeker who came through our Tamil FB page and was connected to Pioneer Esekia. He was working in Qatar at the time, carrying a heavy heart. Born into a devout Hindu family, Anand had gone there with hopes of securing a job but those hopes quickly crumbled. The job he had expected never came, leaving him without food, without shelter and without peace. Alone and in deep distress, Anand felt as though his life had lost all meaning.
It was in this moment of brokenness that God reached out to him. When Anand shared his struggles, Pioneer Esekia prayed earnestly and shared the life-giving Word of God. Right there, in the midst of despair, Anand opened his heart and accepted Jesus as the Savior of his life.
From that day, Pioneer Esekia prayed daily for Anand. Just three days later, God answered and Anand received a permanent job with accommodation provided. This was no coincidence, but God’s loving hand at work. Wanting to make sure Anand was not left alone, Pioneer Esekia asked his own brother to visit him. To their amazement, his brother lived close by.
He soon met Anand, prayed with him, helped him in many ways and introduced him to the church he attended. Today, Anand is a faithful part of that fellowship, attending worship services every Friday. Though he faces temptations living alone, he now finds strength to overcome through his faith in Jesus. Friday, the day set aside for worship, is also a holiday and the day his friends often call him. Yet, Anand chooses first to worship God. 
Anand’s faith continues to grow day by day. He now looks forward to receiving water baptism before returning home to Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Pioneer Esekia also visited Anand’s family in Sri Lanka, sharing the Good News with them and teaching them God’s Word.

Sri Lanka,SIN,,Multiple outcomes,Families,Community,September 2025,"It was approximately three years ago when a seeker named Sharmini from Naiwala reached out to us through our Sinhala Facebook page. Initially, I assumed she was from Nawala, a well-known town close to our church, as I had never heard of Naiwala. I connected her with our church, and she attended for about a month. However, Sharmini informed me that she was actually from the distant village of Naiwala, which is around 50km away from our church and so it is too far for her to come to church. I felt terrible about the mistake and tried to connect her with two  churches in her area, but unfortunately, my attempts were unsuccessful.
For a while, we lost touch with Sharmini, but we continued to call her occasionally. More than a year passed when, to our surprise, Sharmini returned to our church on a Sunday. Despite the long distance, she had decided to come back and now attends regularly. She eventually brought her sister, and now both of them come to the church frequently.
Sharmini has since started reaching out to people in her neighborhood. Recently, she brought a young boy from her neighborhood, and he accepted the Lord. Last Sunday, Sharmini's sister who earlier said she doesn't know how to pray,  testified that she had some physical ailments but prayed for herself and experienced healing from the Lord. They also participate in the church's weekly prayers and the pastor has been working on discipleship lessons with them.
Sharmini's story has reminded me that although some seekers may fall away from their faith journey, the Lord can still work in their hearts and bring them back, sometimes even years later. This encouraging testimony proves that faith is not just a once-in-a-lifetime decision, but a continuous journey with God.

Sri Lanka,SIN,,Multiple outcomes,Explorer growth ,Both,September 2025,"About a month ago, we were able to connect a Muslim seeker  that came through one of our Facebook pages with our Pioneer Rasik. Faisal, a permanent resident of the Nuwara Eliya area in the hill country of Sri Lanka, was carrying a heavy burden at the time. One day, while standing at the Haputale railway station, weighed down by overwhelming debt and hopelessness, he had made up his mind to step in front of a train and end his life. It was at this point that our pioneer spoke to him on the phone. 
 Pioneer Rasik  explained to him that in Jesus there is a solution to every problem. He encouraged Faisal to come and meet him personally so that he could experience the freedom that only Christ can bring. 
 
Around that time, Pioneer Rasik had already organized a three day series of Gospel meetings and fellowship time at a Hotel in Kandy. He invited Faisal to come but Faisal did not attend on the first day because he had felt some fear and doubt about Rasik and his team. 
 
But on the second day, Faisal came to the Gospel meeting and what he witnessed touched his heart deeply. He saw people listening to God’s Word with open hearts, learning from it, reflecting on it and many being baptized. He saw lives being changed through Jesus.
 
That day, Pioneer Rasik shared God’s word with Faisal, encouraged him and prayed for him. It was there that Faisal made the decision to accept Jesus as his Savior and Lord. As he prayed, tears streamed down his face. He said it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted off him and for the first time in a long time, he felt truly free. Faisal even said that not even at his mother’s passing away had he cried, but when he surrendered his life to Jesus, he could not hold back his tears. 
 
Now Faisal stands strong in his faith in Jesus and attends the friday meetings that our pioneer’s team has for Muslim converts.

As he prayed, tears streamed down his face. He said it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted off him and for the first time in a long time, he felt truly free. Faisal even said that not even at his mother’s passing away had he cried, but when he surrendered his life to Jesus, he could not hold back his tears. 
 
Now Faisal stands strong in his faith in Jesus and attends the friday meetings that our pioneer’s team has for Muslim converts.  Pioneer Rasik is preparing once again to hold Gospel meetings in the Nuwara Eliya area and Faisal is looking forward to supporting these events. Rasik gives all Glory to God for rescuing Faisal at the very brink of despair and giving him a new life in Christ.');"
Indonesia,SUN,,Church connection,Explorer growth ,Both,September 2025,"""My name is Agus, and I serve as a Pioneer CV worker among the Sundanese people, the largest unreached people group in Indonesia, with a population of around 40 million. Recently, I followed up with a Seeker who connected with the Direct team's Sundanese-language page, Kalam Gusti. Though he lives far from me, we were able to talk regularly through video calls.
 
This is Pak Apid. In his younger years, he was deeply involved in a radical Islamic movement called Jamaah Islamiyah. He opposed the government, was eventually arrested, and endured punishment and violence before leaving the group. Later, he joined an Islamic missionary movement, yet his heart remained restless. He told me he always felt chased by fear. As he grew older, thoughts of death haunted him, because he still had no assurance of salvation.
 
One day, he encountered one of Kalam Gusti's posts, which conveyed the Word of God in the Sundanese language and culture. Reading it, he was struck by a peace he had never known. His heart felt calm for the first time. He reached out for help, first through the bot and then online chat, and later he was connected directly to me.
 
I shared with him the good news of Isa Al-Masih: who He is, and why He alone is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). For years, Pak Apid had prayed, “Ihdinas Sirotol Mustaqim (show us the straight path)” Now he realized Isa Himself is that path.
 
Today, Pak Apid is studying the Bible and being discipled. He downloaded the Scriptures on his phone and reads them daily. Each morning, I send him verses to strengthen his new faith. Please pray for him, that his joy in Isa Al-Masih will grow, and that God will also open the hearts of his family.

Africa,ARA,,Salvation,Explorer growth ,Community,September 2025,"For the very first time in my life, I saw something about Christ—it was just an advertisement on a Facebook page. Out of curiosity, I clicked on it and decided to reach out. Immediately, Ibrahim responded with kindness and gave me his WhatsApp number so that we could continue the conversation.
 
From that moment, everything began to change. We started chatting every day, and he shared with me things I had never heard before. I grew up knowing only the teachings of Islam, but now I was hearing about forgiveness, love, and what Jesus had done for me and for the whole world. Each day I discovered something new and good, and the message touched my heart deeply.
 
I came to understand that Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sins and for everyone’s sins. For the first time, I realized that I could be forgiven—not because of my works, but because of what He had already done for me. As the Bible says, ‘In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace’ (Ephesians 1:7).
 
Soon after, I made the decision to believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. My life changed completely. Now I have real hope. I know with certainty that my sins are forgiven, and I am going to heaven. This is something I never had when I was a Muslim. Before, I lived in fear, never knowing if God accepted me. But now, I have peace in my heart, because the Word of God says, ‘I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life’ (1 John 5:13).
 
I no longer carry the heavy burden of guilt, because I believe the promise of Scripture: ‘But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us’ (Romans 5:8). What a joy to know that Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross was for me!
 
Now, I don’t want to keep this good news to myself. I want to share the Gospel with my people, especially with girls like me. I want them to experience the forgiveness, hope, and eternal life that I have found in Christ.”",,"INSERT INTO upg_testimonies (country, outcome, impacting, date_posted, testimony) VALUES ('Africa', 'Salvation', 'Explorer growth ', 'September 2025', 'For the very first time in my life, I saw something about Christ—it was just an advertisement on a Facebook page.

Nepal,NEP,,Salvation,Explorer growth ,Community,October 2025,"Manisha Magar is a 20-year-old girl from Lumbini Province, Nepal. She reached out to us through pathway Love during one of the most difficult times in her life. Manisha shared that she has been struggling with depression, often feeling sad, lonely, and misunderstood. She felt that no one truly listened to her or cared about how she was feeling. Lost and searching for peace, she sent us a simple but heartfelt message saying that she wanted to find inner calm. Deep inside, she was longing for peace, love, and hope in her heart.
As we began talking with her, we gently introduced her to Jesus. We could sense that her heart was open and ready to receive. She listened quietly and carefully as we shared about how deeply Jesus loves her how He understands her sadness, forgives her, and offers a peace that no one else can give. Manisha was deeply touched by what she heard. She said she wants to follow Jesus and learn how to live in His truth and love.
We prayed together, asking God to comfort her, heal her heart, give her peace of mind, and guide her on the right path. Now, Manisha desires to stay connected and grow step by step in her new faith journey.
Manisha’s story is a beautiful reminder that God is always near especially when we feel broken, sad, or alone. Even when we think no one understands us, God does. He cares for us deeply and never leaves us.

Finding no satisfactory answer in Islam, he reached out to me online to learn more.
