It is sometimes perceived as a threat to their cultural identity, as it may erode traditional practices and beliefs that are central to the Magar way of life. Fear of social ostracism within tight-knit communities discourages many from openly exploring the faith. The deeply ingrained syncretism of animism, Bon, Hinduism, and Buddhism makes embracing a new monotheistic religion complex and difficult. Additionally, the remote locations of many Magar villages hinder consistent missionary outreach. Limited availability of Christian resources in Magar Dhut and Kham further complicates efforts to spread the faith.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">The Chhetri&#39;s deep-rooted Hindu practices and social structure, including caste-related traditions, can pose significant obstacles to converting to Christianity.
