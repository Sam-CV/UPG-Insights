2023	Japan	Keywords	Find out which keywords japanese respond the most	Version c won with keywords: meaning & hope in japanese 人生の意味(meaning of life) and 希望 (hope for future)
2023	Japan	Keywords	Which keywords people respond the most:Testing: failure, stopping, giving up, losing	Version c won with the lines "止めようとあらゆる手を尽くしたが、できなかった". in english (it says: i've tried everything but still can't.)
2023	Japan	Format	Testing square vs vertical voice over, Which dimension will get better response	Version with vertical won, seems like voice over is getting good response, also protection theme has good response, keywords were (anxiety and fear)
2023	Japan	Keywords	Testing the keywords: storm in life as problems, in relationships, marriages, finances, and work	Version b won. lines "あなたの財政の嵐あなたの人間関係の嵐" in english its about finance and relationships. but overall results werent so good. looks like storm in japanese isn't used as metaphor regarding challenges.
2023	Japan	Keywords	I wanted to test some japanese keywords (tasukeru -- to save, jitto shiteru -- stay still) and i also wanted to check response from this style of call to actioin).	It had somewhat low response rate, given than we had 28000 plus viewership but only 38 clicks. maybe this style of content is not very convincing. thinking of changing the style a bit.
2023	Japan	Keywords	I want to test out keyword rejection, worth, identity, finding identity. We want to learn which of the words resonate the most	Seems like "identity" "アイデンティティ" has an impact to japanese. with 36 clicks and 35 watching whole thing, tat was really good retention. meg has good connection, i think. and also the bgm helped as well, it was more cinematic style.
2023	Japan	VO	I want to test how voice over performs over other styles	It had 28 clicks and 96 watching till end. it seems like voice over has better response rate. or rather, keeping the video the same throughout satisfies audience expectation. compared to previous style of changing intro / mid / outro.
2023	Japan	Keywords	I want to test keywords regarding human hearts needs. (keywords such as "longing / fitting in / satisfaction"	Perhaps the title might be a little religious, so that's why it didnt get more views as i would've wanted. i'll try to make titles simpler next time.
2023	Japan	Keywords	Testing keywords and title and re-confirming. I want to see how people respond with bible words / name on the title	As expected, we're getting less response with biblical words. i think it needs to be japanese culture centered, or relevance with their society rather than using biblical words
2023	Japan	Topic	I want to see japanese response to church idea. Let's find out if there are any interest for church in japan	Apparently not. with 0 clicks and just 1 viewership. the idea of church is very low interest for japanese
